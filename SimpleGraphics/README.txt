The include .lib and headers are found in the CharisAPI folder.

This folder contains a project for a quick and easy to use graphics API called Charis. 
Charis is a wrapper around OpenGL where the intent is for the user to only care 
about designing models and shaders. Charis is not a project about optimization, but
instead a project about simplyfying the process of getting fun things on screen 
(and for me to better understand OpenGL).

The TestProject folder is not included in Charis. Instead it is a tiny demo of how
Charis works. Start by looking at the function HelloTriangle() and then HelloSquare(),
both found in Main.cpp.
